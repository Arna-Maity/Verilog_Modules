## Random Digital Building Blocks

This Repo consists of some random Digital Building Blocks which can be used as a starting point for more complex Digital Designs.
As of now the set of Building blocks already implemented is fairly minimal, but i hope to expand this set as time passes.

My main aim of creating such Building Blocks was to get some practical experience in Digital Design using an HDL. Moreover this would also help one in improving their knowledge of Digital Design.
Anyone interested in using my Design Blocks is welcome. It can also serve as another resource for learning Digital Design.
